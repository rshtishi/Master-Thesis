# Master-Thesis

A compiler for running algorithms written in Albanian language pseudocode.

## Business Case

In computer science, pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm. Pseudocode is used by students,
beginners and experienced developers for finding an algorithm that will solve the problem. The reason why it is used:
-  describing a solution without the burden or weight of complex syntax
-  eases the communication with other people (they don't need to know the implementation language) because it uses short terms or simple Albanian language
-  takes fewer lines to describe a solution

We have developed a compiler that will be able to make the pseudocode executable.
